	abstract = {We discuss analogs based on elliptic curves over finite fields of public key cryptosystems which use the multiplicative group of a finite field. These elliptic curve cryptosystems may be more secure, because the analog of the discrete logarithm problem on elliptic curves is likely to be harder than the classical discrete logarithm problem, especially over . We discuss the question of primitive points on an elliptic curve modulo p, and give a theorem on nonsmoothness of the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by a global point.},

	abstract = {Wireless sensor networks for monitoring and steering industrial systems have emerged as an important new application area for wireless embedded technology in safety-related systems. Therefore several hardware platforms can be targeted. Due to their flexibility and reconfigurability along with high performance and power efficiency, modern Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are an excellent platform to realize such intelligent sensor networks. On one hand, FPGAs can integrate embedded processors and on-chip memory into a single die and can be easily configured to interface with a wide variety of popular communications protocols like SPI, UART and I2C, which are used for sensor communication. On the other hand, the reconfigurability of FPGAs supports the design of self-organizing computing systems, which are increasingly used in sensor applications. In this paper an FPGA-based wireless smart sensor network that integrates acceleration sensors for increasing safety aspects in cognitive systems used for industrial communication is presented.},

	abstract = {Wireless sensor networks have attracted a lot of interest over the last decade in wireless and mobile computing research community. Applications of these networks are numerous and growing, which range from indoor deployment scenarios in the home and office to outdoor deployment in adversary's territory in a tactical battleground. However, due to distributed nature and their deployment in remote areas, these networks are vulnerable to numerous security threats that can adversely affect their performance. This chapter provides a comprehensive discussion on the state of the art in security technologies for wireless sensor networks. It identifies various possible attacks at different layers of the communication protocol stack in a typical sensor network and their possible countermeasures. A brief discussion on the future direction of research in WSN security is also included.},

	doi = {10.1109/TENCON.2016.7848043},
	abstract = {In public key cryptography, RSA algorithm has been used for a long time, but it does not meet the constraints of WSNs. Elliptic Curve Cryptography(ECC) has been employed recently because of its high security for same length bit. ECC point multiplication operation is time consuming which affects the speed of encryption and decryption of data. In this paper, we propose the point multiplication using Montgomery multiplication technique that achieves considerable speed and with reduced area utilization. The ECC is first simulated on different FPGA devices, with key length 112 and 163 bits and the area-speed tradeoff is compared. ECC algorithm is implemented with software and hardware choosing Artix 7 XC7a100t-3csg324 FPGA which supports key lengths of 112 and 163 bits. The proposed ECC algorithm is modeled using VHDL and synthesized on Spartan 3 and 6, Virtex 4, 5 and 6 and Artix 7 before the hardware implementation on Atrix 7. The design satisfies the needs of resource constrained WSNs devices with equal key length and data size, the device utilization is within 13 percentage.},
